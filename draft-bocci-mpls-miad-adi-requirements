    Requirements for MPLS Label Stack Indicators for Ancillary Data
               draft-bocci-mpls-miad-adi-requirements-00

Abstract

   This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
   stack of ancillary data that exists below the label stack.  This work
   is the product of the IETF MPLS Open Design Team.  Requirements are
   derived from a number of new proposals for additions to the MPLS
   label stack to allow forwarding or other processing decisions to be
   made, either by a transit or terminating LSR, based on application
   data that may be in or below the bottom of the label stack.

1.  Introduction

   There is significant interest in developing the MPLS data plane to
   address the requirements of new applications.  These applications
   typically include ancillary data that is contained in or below the
   label stack.  There is a requirement for this data to be either
   intercepted and processed, or some other forwarding decision to be
   made.  This makes use of mechanisms implemented by an intermediate or
   egress label switching router (LSR) that complies with the MPLS base
   architecture and potentially its extensions, including (but not
   limited to) [RFC3031], [RFC3032], [RFC6790].

   This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label
   stack to support these applications.

1.1.  Terminology

   o  Ancillary Data: Data relating to the MPLS packet that may be used
      to affect the forwarding or other processing of that packet,
      either at the LER or LSR.  This data may be implicit (i.e.
      context-specific), encoded withing the label stack (in-stack
      data), after the bottom of the label stack but not considered a
      part of the payload, or within the payload.

   o  In-Stack: Any location within the MPLS label stack including the
      outer label and the bottom of stack (the label with the S-bit
      set).

   o  Ancillary Data Indicator (ADI): A indicator in the MPLS label
      stack that ancillary data exists in this packet.  It may also
      indicate the specific type of the ancillary data.

1.2.  Background

   The MPLS architecture is specified in [RFC3031] and provides a
   mechanism for forwarding packets through a network without requiring
   any analysis of the packet payload's network layer header by
   intermediate nodes (Label Switching Routers - LSRs).  Formally,
   inspection may only occur at network ingress (the Label edge router -
   LER) where the packet is assigned to a forwarding equivalence class
   (FEC).

   MPLS uses switching based on a label pushed on the packet to achieve
   efficient forwarding and traffic engineering of flows associated with
   the FEC.  While originally used for IP traffic, MPLS has been
   extended to support point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
   multipoint-to-mulitipoint layer 2 and layer 3 services.  An overview
   of the development of MPLS is provided in
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer].

   A number of applications have emerged which require LSRs to make
   forwarding or other processing decisions based on inspection of the
   network layer header, or some other ancillary information in the
   protocol stack encapsulated deeper in the packet.  An early example
   of this was generation of a hash of the payload header to be used for
   load balancing over Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) or Link Aggregation
   Group (LAG) next hops.  This is based on an assumption that the
   network layer protocol is IP.  MPLS was extended to avoid the need
   for LSRs to perform this operation if load balancing was needed based
   on the payload and instead use only the MPLS label stack, using the
   Entropy Label / Entropy Label Indicator [RFC6790]which are inserted
   at the LER.  Other applications where the intermediate LSRs may need
   to inspect and process a packet on an LSP include OAM, which can make
   use of mechanisms such the Router Alert Label [RFC3032] or the
   Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) [RFC5586] to indicate that an
   intercepted packet should be processed locally.  See
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer] for detailed list of such applications.

   There have been a number of new proposals for how ancillary data is
   carried in MPLS and how its presence is indicated to the LSR or
   egress LER, for example In-situ OAM and Service Function Chaining
   (SFC).  A summary of these proposals is contained

   in[I-D.bryant-mpls-dev-primer], an overview of use cases is provided
   in [Reference to MIAD use cases].[I-D.song-mpls-extension-header]
   summarises some of the issues with existing solutions to address
   these new applications:

      These solutions rely on either the built-in next-protocol
      indicator in the header or the knowledge of the format and size of
      the header to access the following packet data.  The node is
      required to be able to parse the new header, which is unrealistic
      in an incremental deployment environment.

      A piecemeal solution often assumes the new header is the only
      extra header and its location in the packet is fixed by default.
      It is impossible or difficult to support multiple new headers in
      one packet due to the conflicted assumption.  An example of this
      is that the GAL/G-ACH mechanism assumes that if the GAL is
      present, only a single G-ACH header follows.

   New applications therefore require the definition of extensions to
   the MPLS architecture and label stack operations that can be used
   across these applications in order to minimise implemention
   complexity and promote interoperability.

2.  MPLS Ancillary Data Indicator Requirements

   This document specifies requirements of MPLS Indicators for
   Ancilliary Data (MIAD).  The requirements are for the behavior of the
   protocol mechanisms and procedures that constitute building blocks
   out of which mechanisms for indicating ancilliary data that exists in
   the MPLS payload using the MPLS label stack (so-called in-stack
   indicators) are constructed.  It does not specify the detailed
   processing that may be required by an application of that ancilliary
   data by an LSR.  The requirements in this document do not describe
   what functions MIAD implementation supports.  The purpose of this
   document is to identify the toolkit and any new protocol work that is
   required.  This new protocol work MUST be based on the existing MPLS
   architecture.

2.1.  General Requirements

   o  MPLS combines extensibility, flexibility and efficiency by using
      control plane context combined with a simple data plane mechanism
      to allow the network to make forwarding decisions about a packet.
      Any solution MUST maintain these properties of MPLS.

   o  Any solutions to these requirements MUST not restrict the
      generality of MPLS architecture.

Internet-Draft            MIAD ADI Requirements             October 2021


   o  Any solution MUST respect the principle that Special Purpose
      Labels are the mechanism of last resort.

   o  Solutions MUST be able to coexist with and not obsolete existing
      MPLS mechanisms.

   o  Neither an ADI or ancilliary data must be delivered to a node that
      is not capable of processing it.

   o  Care needs to be taken in the coeistence of ancillary data and
      existing post-stack data mechanisms.

   o  Mechanisms are required to determine that all nodes that need to
      process the ancillary data can read the required distance into the
      packet at that node.

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED for Ancilliary Data Indicators to indicate
      the presence of ancilliary data in the MPLS label stack (Ed. note:
      This is similar to ELI).

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED for Ancilliary Data Indicators to indicate
      the presence of ancilliary data below the MPLS label stack (Ed.
      note: this is similar to GAL/G-ACH).

   o  The mechanism to indicate that Ancilliary Data is present MUST
      operate in the context of the top of stack LSE.

   o  Ancilliary data may be associated with control or maintenance
      information for traffic carried by an LSP, or it may be associated
      with the user traffic itself.

   o  Ancilliary Data Indicators (ADIs) SHOULD make use of existing MPLS
      data plane operations.  If extensions to the MPLS data plane are
      required, they MUST NOT be inconsitent with the MPLS architecture.

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LER inserting ADIs to
      determine whether LSRs along the path can parse the label stack
      and process the ADI at the location it is inserted.

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LER inserting ADIs to
      determine if the ADI will be processed by LSRs along the path.

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LER inserting ADIs to
      determine if the far-end LER can accept and process a packet
      containing a given ADI.

   o  ADIs SHOULD be supported for both P2P and P2MP paths, but any
      specific ADI may only be supported for one or the other.

Internet-Draft            MIAD ADI Requirements             October 2021


   o  Data plane mechanisms for ADIs MUST be independent of the control
      plane type (LDP, RSVP, BGP, static, IGP, etc).

   o  A mechanism MUST be defined for control planes (LDP, RSVP, BGP,
      static, IGP, etc) to determine the ability of downstream LSRs/LERs
      to accept/process a given ADI.

   o  A mechanism is REQUIRED to enable an LSR to efficiently determine
      if an ADI is present in a packet.

   o  ADIs can only be inserted at LERs, but may be processed at LSRs
      and LERs.  If it is required to insert an ADI at a transit router
      on an LSP, then a new label stack must be pushed. .

   o  It SHOULD be possible to include indicators for ancillary data for
      multiple applications in the same packet, but each ADI only
      supports one application.

   o  It MUST be possible to insert new ADIs for new applications on the
      same LSP.[Ed note: neet to clarify]

   o  The solution must allow ADI and non-ADI packets to coexist on the
      same LSP.

   o  The solution must support the processing of a subset of the ADIs
      on a packet.

   o  The solution MUST support slow path processing of ancilliary data.

   o  The solution MUST support fast path processing of ancilliary data.

   o  The solution MUST support hop-by-hop processing of ancilliary
      data.

   o  The solution MUST support end-to-end processing of ancilliary
      data.

   o  If both hop-by-hop and and end-to-end ancilliary data indicators
      are present together, the prescendence must be specified in the
      design.

   o  In order to prevent unnecesary scanning of the packet, care needs
      to be taken in the location of the ancillary data, for example it
      should be located as close to the label stack as possible.

   o  A solition must be provided to verify the authenticity of
      ancillary data processed to LSRs.

   o  The design of the ADIs and ancillary data must not expose
      confidential information to the LSRs.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms required by this document introduce new security
   considerations to MPLS.  It is expected that individual solutions
   meeting these requirements will address any security considerations.
